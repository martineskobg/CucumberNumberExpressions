# Cucumber Number Expressions

## This is a Maven project created for training purples.

#### Description
I've created this project to test the functionality of two calculators (SumCalculator and DifferenceCalculator), to gain experience with "Java", "Cucumber", "BDD" and JUnit. In this project I have created
some additional helper classes for better testing. 
* BaseType.class: By using generics this class can cast an object in any type and return it.
  Currently, it has only two method  for Integer and Double

* TableColumnValues: This class can be used to extract values from Data table. Also has methods which takes
List of Integers/ Doubles and by using the calculators they return total sum/ difference of all elements in the List.

#### Instruction
You can run the test by following the steps below:

1. Go to src directory of the project
2. Than open test --> runner
3. And run TestRunner.java class
